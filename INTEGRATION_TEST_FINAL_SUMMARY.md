# Integration Test Modification - Final Summary

## Objective
Modify the integration tests to test the API routes `/api/crud6/groups`, `/api/crud6/groups/1` and the frontend routes `/crud6/groups` and `/crud6/groups/1`, and take screenshots of the results if possible.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Endpoint Testing

#### GET /api/crud6/groups (Groups List)
- **Authentication Test**: Verifies 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests
- **Authorization Test**: Verifies 403 Forbidden for users without `uri_crud6` permission
- **Data Test**: Verifies 200 OK with valid JSON response for authorized users
- **Implementation**: Both CI workflow and PHP unit tests

#### GET /api/crud6/groups/1 (Single Group)
- **Authentication Test**: Verifies 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests
- **Authorization Test**: Verifies 403 Forbidden for users without `uri_crud6` permission
- **Data Test**: Verifies 200 OK with correct group data (id, slug, name, etc.)
- **Error Test**: Verifies 404 Not Found for non-existent groups
- **Implementation**: Both CI workflow and PHP unit tests

### 2. Frontend Route Testing

#### /crud6/groups (Groups List Page)
- **Route Test**: Verifies page loads successfully (200) or redirects (302)
- **Screenshot**: Full-page screenshot captured with Playwright
- **CI Integration**: Automated test in GitHub Actions workflow

#### /crud6/groups/1 (Group Detail Page)
- **Route Test**: Verifies page loads successfully (200) or redirects (302)
- **Screenshot**: Full-page screenshot captured with Playwright
- **CI Integration**: Automated test in GitHub Actions workflow

### 3. Screenshot Capability

#### Implementation
- **Tool**: Playwright (Chromium browser)
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 viewport
- **Type**: Full-page screenshots
- **Storage**: GitHub Actions artifacts
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Files Generated**:
  - `screenshot_groups_list.png` - List page
  - `screenshot_group_detail.png` - Detail page

#### Access
1. Go to GitHub repository → Actions tab
2. Click on workflow run
3. Scroll to "Artifacts" section at bottom
4. Download "integration-test-screenshots.zip"

## Technical Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Playwright Setup:**
```bash
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

**Screenshot Script:**
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
// Takes full-page screenshots with 1280x720 viewport
// Waits for networkidle before capture
// Handles errors gracefully
```

**Artifact Upload:**
```yaml
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
with:
  name: integration-test-screenshots
  path: /tmp/screenshot_*.png
  retention-days: 30
```

### PHP Unit Tests

**Base Class:**
```php
extends AdminTestCase
use RefreshDatabase;
use WithTestUser;
use MockeryPHPUnitIntegration;
```

**Test Pattern:**
```php
public function testExample(): void
{
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    $this->actAsUser($user, permissions: ['uri_crud6']);
    $request = $this->createJsonRequest('GET', '/api/crud6/groups');
    $response = $this->handleRequest($request);
    $this->assertResponseStatus(200, $response);
}
```
