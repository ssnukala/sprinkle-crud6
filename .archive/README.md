# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation, fix summaries, and issue-specific guides that were created during the development of the CRUD6 sprinkle. These documents are preserved for future reference but have been moved out of the repository root to keep it clean and organized.

This archive contains:
- **Fix Summaries**: Detailed documentation of bug fixes and their implementations
- **Visual Comparisons**: Before/after comparisons showing code changes
- **Issue-Specific Guides**: Documentation created for specific GitHub issues and PRs
- **Testing Guides**: Historical testing approaches and procedures
- **Implementation Summaries**: Details of feature implementations and refactorings
- **Checklists**: Completion checklists for various fixes and features

## Archive Organization

Files are organized by topic:
- `*_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Summaries of specific fixes
- `*_FIX.md` - Detailed fix documentation
- `VISUAL_*.md` - Visual comparisons and diagrams

## Active Documentation

## Note

This directory is tracked by git and all files are committed to the repository. If you need to reference historical documentation, you can:
1. Browse this directory in your local clone or on GitHub
2. View the git history for specific files
3. Search through git commits for detailed information

## Contributing

When creating new documentation:
- Place active/current documentation in the repository root (only core docs like README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- Place fix summaries, issue-specific docs, and temporary documentation in `.archive/`
- Use descriptive filenames that include issue/PR numbers when applicable
- Include dates and context to help with future reference
