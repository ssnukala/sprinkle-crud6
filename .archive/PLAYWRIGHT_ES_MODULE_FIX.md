# Playwright ES Module Fix - Integration Testing

## Issue

The integration test workflow was failing with the error:
```
file:///home/runner/work/sprinkle-crud6/sprinkle-crud6/userfrosting/take_screenshots.js:1
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
                     ^

ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/home/runner/work/sprinkle-crud6/sprinkle-crud6/userfrosting/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
```

This occurred when the screenshot capture script tried to execute in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Root Cause

The problem was with module system mismatch:

1. **package.json configuration**: The UserFrosting project's `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, which makes Node.js treat all `.js` files as ES modules
2. **Script syntax**: The `take_screenshots.js` script was using CommonJS syntax (`require()`)
3. **Module system conflict**: ES modules require `import` statements, not `require()`

**Sequence that caused the failure**:
```bash
cd userfrosting
npm install playwright                    # Installs playwright
cat > take_screenshots.js << 'EOF'        # Creates script with require()
const { chromium } = require('playwright'); # CommonJS syntax
...
EOF
node take_screenshots.js                  # Node.js expects ES module syntax
                                          # Error: require is not defined in ES module scope
```

## Solution

### Changes Made

Modified `.github/workflows/integration-test.yml` to use Playwright's CLI command (`npx playwright screenshot`) instead of creating a custom Node.js script. This approach:
- Avoids the ES module vs CommonJS issue entirely
- Uses Playwright's built-in screenshot functionality
- Simplifies the workflow
- Matches the pattern used in the reference repository (`ssnukala/sprinkle-learntegrate`)

**Before** (Custom Node.js script):
```yaml
cat > take_screenshots.js << 'EOF'
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  // ... screenshot logic ...
})();
EOF
node take_screenshots.js
```

**After** (Playwright CLI):
```yaml
npx playwright screenshot --browser chromium \
  --viewport-size=1280,720 \
  --full-page \
  --timeout 10000 \
  http://localhost:8080/crud6/groups /tmp/screenshot_groups_list.png

npx playwright screenshot --browser chromium \
  --viewport-size=1280,720 \
  --full-page \
  --timeout 10000 \
  http://localhost:8080/crud6/groups/1 /tmp/screenshot_group_detail.png
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed custom script**: Eliminated the need to create a Node.js script file
2. **Use Playwright CLI**: Used `npx playwright screenshot` command directly
3. **Same functionality**: Maintains the same viewport size (1280x720) and full-page screenshots
4. **Error handling**: Added error handling with `|| echo` to prevent workflow failures
5. **Cleaner output**: Added section headers for better readability

## Technical Details

### ES Modules vs CommonJS

**ES Modules** (modern JavaScript):
```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';
```

**CommonJS** (legacy Node.js):
```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
```

When `package.json` contains `"type": "module"`, Node.js treats `.js` files as ES modules and expects `import` syntax.

### Playwright CLI Screenshot Command

The `npx playwright screenshot` command provides a simple way to take screenshots without writing custom scripts:

```bash
npx playwright screenshot [options] <url> <filename>
```

**Options used**:
- `--browser chromium`: Use Chromium browser
- `--viewport-size=1280,720`: Set viewport dimensions
- `--full-page`: Capture full page, not just viewport
- `--timeout 10000`: Set 10-second timeout

### Why This Fix Works

1. **No script file needed**: Playwright CLI handles everything
2. **No module system issues**: CLI is independent of project's module system
3. **Simpler workflow**: Less code to maintain
4. **Same results**: Produces identical screenshots as the custom script
5. **Better error handling**: Failures don't break the workflow

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/integration-test.yml`**
   - Removed custom script creation (lines 280-322)
   - Added Playwright CLI commands (lines 278-305)
   - Simplified from ~50 lines to ~30 lines
   - Maintained same functionality

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When the integration test workflow runs:
1. ✅ Playwright npm package is available in `userfrosting/node_modules`
2. ✅ Chromium browser binaries are installed
3. ✅ `npx playwright screenshot` commands execute successfully
4. ✅ Screenshots are captured and saved to `/tmp/screenshot_*.png`
5. ✅ Artifacts are uploaded correctly
6. ✅ No ES module errors occur

## Validation

- [x] YAML syntax validated with Python yaml parser
- [x] Changes follow reference implementation from `ssnukala/sprinkle-learntegrate`
- [x] No breaking changes to functionality
- [x] Artifact paths unchanged
- [x] Error handling preserved and improved
- [x] Simpler and more maintainable solution

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the ES module error that occurred after the previous fix (documented in `PLAYWRIGHT_SCREENSHOT_PATH_FIX.md`) successfully resolved the module resolution issue. 

### Evolution of the Fix

1. **First issue** (`PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_FIX.md`): Playwright package not installed
   - Solution: Added `npm install playwright`

2. **Second issue** (`PLAYWRIGHT_SCREENSHOT_PATH_FIX.md`): Module resolution problem
   - Solution: Created script in correct directory

3. **Third issue** (this fix): ES module vs CommonJS syntax
   - Solution: Use Playwright CLI instead of custom script

The current solution is the most robust as it:
- Eliminates the need for custom scripts
- Avoids module system complexities
- Uses Playwright's built-in functionality
- Follows best practices from the reference repository

## Reference

This solution was inspired by the implementation in `ssnukala/sprinkle-learntegrate/files/.github/workflows/integration-test.yml`, which uses the same Playwright CLI approach successfully.
