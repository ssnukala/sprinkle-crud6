# CRUD6 Frontend Fix Summary

## Changes Reverted

The previous "framework-independent" changes have been reverted to restore full UserFrosting 6 framework integration as requested in issue #26.

## Current State - Full UserFrosting 6 Integration

### 1. UserFrosting Components Restored

**PageCRUD6s.vue** - Now uses UserFrosting framework:
- Uses `UFTable` component from `@userfrosting/sprinkle-admin`
- Full integration with UserFrosting table features (pagination, sorting, filtering)
- Proper translation calls using `$t()` function
- CRUD6-specific translation keys from `app/locale/en_US/messages.php`

**PageCRUD6.vue** - Full framework integration:
- Uses UserFrosting translation system throughout
- Proper `$t('CRUD6.EDIT')` and other CRUD6-specific translations
- Framework-integrated form handling and validation

### 2. Translation Dependencies Restored

All components now use:
- `$t('CRUD6.CREATE')` for create buttons
- `$t('CRUD6.EDIT')` for edit functionality  
- `$t('LOADING')` for loading states
- `$t('YES')` and `$t('NO')` for boolean values
- Framework's translation system instead of hardcoded strings

### 3. UserFrosting Framework Services

Components utilize full framework integration:
- `useAlertsStore()` from `@userfrosting/sprinkle-core/stores`
- `useRuleSchemaAdapter()` for validation
- `UFTable` component with full feature set
- Proper API error handling using UserFrosting patterns

### 4. Framework-Independent Code Removed

- Removed custom `UFTableCRUD6` component 
- Removed hardcoded Bootstrap HTML tables
- Removed standalone translation approach
- Restored dependency on UserFrosting 6 framework components

## Framework Integration Benefits

1. **Full Feature Set**: Access to all UserFrosting 6 table features
2. **Consistent UI**: Matches UserFrosting admin interface
3. **Translation System**: Proper i18n with CRUD6-specific keys
4. **Validation**: Framework-integrated form validation
5. **Alerts**: Unified alert/notification system
6. **Permissions**: Integration with UserFrosting authorization

The CRUD6 sprinkle now fully utilizes UserFrosting 6 framework features as intended.
