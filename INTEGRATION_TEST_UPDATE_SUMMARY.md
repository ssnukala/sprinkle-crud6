# Integration Test Workflow Update Summary

## Issue
The integration test setup had issues and was not following the recommended UserFrosting 6 installation approach as described in the issue and the [UserFrosting 6 discussion](https://github.com/orgs/userfrosting/discussions/1261).

## Changes Made

### 1. Installation Method Change
**Before:**
```yaml
git clone --branch 6.0.0-beta.5 --depth 1 https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting.git userfrosting
```

**After:**
```yaml
composer create-project userfrosting/userfrosting userfrosting "^6.0-beta" --no-scripts --no-install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

**Reason:** The `composer create-project` approach is the official UserFrosting 6 installation method and pulls down all necessary files along with core, admin, account sprinkles properly configured.

### 2. Environment File Setup
**Before:**
```yaml
cp app/.env.example app/.env
```

**After:**
```yaml
cp app/.env.docker app/.env
```

**Reason:** Following the user's setup script which uses `.env.docker` as the base configuration file.

### 3. NPM Dependencies Update
**Before:**
```yaml
npm install
npm install ../sprinkle-crud6
npm install @userfrosting/theme-pink-cupcake@^6.0.0-beta
```

**After:**
```yaml
npm update
npm install ../sprinkle-crud6
```

**Reason:** 
- Added `npm update` as per UserFrosting 6 installation guide
- Removed PinkCupcake theme (not required for CRUD6 core functionality testing)

### 4. Frontend Configuration Added
**New Steps:**

#### main.ts Configuration
Creates `app/assets/main.ts` with proper CRUD6Sprinkle plugin setup:
```typescript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createPinia } from 'pinia'
import router from './router'
import App from './App.vue'

/** Setup crud6 Sprinkle */
import CRUD6Sprinkle from '@ssnukala/sprinkle-crud6'

const app = createApp(App)
const pinia = createPinia()

app.use(pinia)
app.use(router)
app.use(CRUD6Sprinkle)

app.mount('#app')
```

#### Router Configuration
Creates `app/assets/router/index.ts` with CRUD6Routes:
```typescript
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import CRUD6Routes from '@ssnukala/sprinkle-crud6/routes'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      children: [
        ...CRUD6Routes
      ]
    }
  ]
})

export default router
```

**Reason:** These files are required as mentioned in the issue's setup steps and properly integrate CRUD6 routes into the application.

### 5. Asset Build Method
**Before:**
```yaml
npm run vite:build
```

**After:**
```yaml
php bakery assets:vite --production
```

**Reason:** Using bakery commands follows the UserFrosting 6 standard approach as documented in the official guide.

### 6. Version Flexibility
**Before:**
```yaml
uf-version: ['6.0.0-beta.5']
```

**After:**
```yaml
uf-version: ['^6.0-beta']
```

**Reason:** Using a version constraint instead of a specific version allows the test to work with any compatible beta release.

## Alignment with UserFrosting 6 Patterns

This update aligns the integration test workflow with the official UserFrosting 6 installation pattern:

1. ✅ Uses `composer create-project` (official method)
2. ✅ Runs `npm update` (fixes known beta issues)
3. ✅ Uses `.env.docker` for configuration
4. ✅ Configures frontend assets properly (main.ts + router)
5. ✅ Uses bakery commands for asset building
6. ✅ Includes only required sprinkles (Core, Account, Admin, CRUD6)

## Expected Benefits

1. **More Reliable Tests**: Follows the official installation method
2. **Better Compatibility**: Works with any 6.0-beta version
3. **Complete Setup**: Includes frontend configuration that was missing
4. **Cleaner Dependencies**: Removes unnecessary theme dependencies
5. **Standard Approach**: Uses UserFrosting 6 standard tools (bakery)

## Testing

The workflow has been validated for:
- ✅ YAML syntax correctness
- ✅ Proper step sequencing
- ✅ Complete frontend configuration
- ✅ Database setup steps
- ✅ Asset build process
