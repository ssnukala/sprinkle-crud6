# PR Summary: Fix Duplicate Schema API Calls

## Issue
When navigating to `/crud6/users/1`, three duplicate schema API calls were being made, resulting in unnecessary network traffic and slower page loads.

## Problem
Three separate components were loading the same schema:
1. **PageDynamic**: Loading full schema to determine render mode
2. **useCRUD6Api**: Loading form schema for validation
3. **PageRow**: Loading detail+form schema for display

All three used different cache keys, so all three API calls were executed.

## Solution
Implemented a three-part fix:

### 1. Removed Schema Loading from PageDynamic
- PageDynamic is just a routing wrapper - it doesn't need schema
- Delegates all schema loading to child components (PageRow/PageMasterDetail)
- Reduced complexity and eliminated one API call

### 2. Smart Context Waiting in Schema Store  
- Added logic to detect when a broader context is already loading
- If requesting 'form' and 'detail,form' is loading, wait instead of making new call
- Leverages existing multi-context caching to serve sub-contexts from broader requests

### 3. Schema Pre-loading in PageRow
- Load schema BEFORE initializing useCRUD6Api to ensure correct execution order
- Guarantees 'detail,form' request starts before useCRUD6Api tries to load 'form'
- Eliminates race condition between PageRow and useCRUD6Api

## Results
- **Before**: 3 API calls per page load
- **After**: 1 API call per page load
- **Improvement**: 67% reduction in schema API calls

## Files Modified
1. `app/assets/views/PageDynamic.vue` - Removed schema loading logic
2. `app/assets/stores/useCRUD6SchemaStore.ts` - Added smart waiting logic
3. `app/assets/views/PageRow.vue` - Added schema pre-loading
4. `app/assets/composables/useCRUD6Api.ts` - Updated comments

## Documentation
- `.archive/DUPLICATE_SCHEMA_CALLS_FIX.md` - Detailed technical explanation
- `.archive/TESTING_GUIDE_DUPLICATE_CALLS.md` - Testing instructions
- `.archive/TEST_SCENARIO_ANALYSIS.md` - Race condition analysis

## Testing
To verify:
1. Navigate to `/crud6/users/1`
2. Open DevTools Network tab
3. Should see only ONE request: `/api/crud6/users/schema?context=detail%2Cform`
4. Console should show "Related context loading" and "Waiting for related context"

## Backward Compatibility
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ Schema caching unchanged
✅ Component APIs unchanged
✅ No breaking changes

## Performance Impact
- Faster page loads (no duplicate requests)
- Reduced server load (67% fewer schema requests)
- Better user experience (instant navigation)
