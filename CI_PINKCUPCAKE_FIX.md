# CI Integration Test Fix - PinkCupcake Dependency Removal

## Problem

The GitHub Actions integration test was failing with the following error:

```
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught UserFrosting\Support\Exception\BadClassNameException: 
Sprinkle recipe class `UserFrosting\Theme\PinkCupcake\PinkCupcake` not found.
```

**Failed Run:** https://github.com/ssnukala/sprinkle-crud6/actions/runs/18296045691/job/52094538234

## Root Cause Analysis

The CI workflow was configured to include `PinkCupcake::class` in the test `MyApp.php` configuration, but the PinkCupcake theme package was not being installed. Here's why:

1. **UserFrosting 6.0.0-beta.5 base installation** does NOT include PinkCupcake by default
   - Only includes: Core, Account, Admin sprinkles
   - PinkCupcake is an optional theme package

2. **sprinkle-crud6 composer.json** does NOT require PinkCupcake
   - Only requires: framework, core, account, admin
   - No theme dependency specified

3. **CI workflow** added PinkCupcake to MyApp.php without installing it first
   - Line 88: `use UserFrosting\Theme\PinkCupcake\PinkCupcake;`
   - Line 100: `PinkCupcake::class,`
   - No corresponding `composer require userfrosting/theme-pink-cupcake` step

4. **PinkCupcake is NOT required** for CRUD6 functionality
   - CRUD6 provides backend API and data models
   - Theme integration is optional and user-configurable

## Solution

Removed PinkCupcake from the CI test configuration since it's:
- Not required for testing CRUD6 functionality
- Not installed by default in UserFrosting 6
- An optional theme choice for end users

### Changes Made

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/integration-test.yml`)
   - Removed `use UserFrosting\Theme\PinkCupcake\PinkCupcake;` import
   - Removed `PinkCupcake::class,` from sprinkles array
   - Test now uses only Core, Account, Admin, and CRUD6 sprinkles

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - `INTEGRATION_TESTING.md`: Added note clarifying PinkCupcake is optional
   - `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md`: Added note with installation instructions for PinkCupcake

## Testing

### Validation Performed
- ✅ YAML syntax validation of workflow file
- ✅ Verified sprinkles configuration follows UserFrosting 6 patterns
- ✅ Documentation updated with clear guidance

### Expected Result
The CI integration test should now pass without the PinkCupcake dependency error:
1. UserFrosting 6.0.0-beta.5 is cloned
2. sprinkle-crud6 is installed as local package
3. MyApp.php is configured with Core, Account, Admin, CRUD6 only
4. All required dependencies are available
5. Tests run successfully

## UserFrosting 6 Pattern Alignment

This fix aligns with UserFrosting 6 patterns:

### Default UserFrosting 6 Configuration
```php
public function getSprinkles(): array
{
    return [
        Core::class,
        Account::class,
        Admin::class,
    ];
}
```

### With CRUD6 Integration
```php
public function getSprinkles(): array
{
    return [
        Core::class,
        Account::class,
        Admin::class,
        CRUD6::class,  // Add for CRUD functionality
    ];
}
```

### Optional Theme Addition
```php
// Only if user wants PinkCupcake theme
// First: composer require userfrosting/theme-pink-cupcake
public function getSprinkles(): array
{
    return [
        Core::class,
        Account::class,
        Admin::class,
        CRUD6::class,
        PinkCupcake::class,  // Optional
    ];
}
```

## Impact

- **Minimal Change**: Only 3 files modified, 5 lines changed
- **No Breaking Changes**: CRUD6 functionality unchanged
- **Better Documentation**: Clear guidance on optional theme usage
- **CI Reliability**: Test no longer fails due to missing optional dependency
- **User Flexibility**: Users can choose any theme or no theme
