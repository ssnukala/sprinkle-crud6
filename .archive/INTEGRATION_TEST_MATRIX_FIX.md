# Integration Test Matrix Strategy Removal

## Problem Statement

The integration test workflow was running 3 concurrent jobs due to a matrix strategy configuration that tested across multiple PHP versions (8.1, 8.2, 8.3). This caused:

1. **Resource Usage**: 3x the CI/CD minutes per workflow run
2. **Longer Feedback Loop**: Need to wait for all 3 jobs to complete before getting full results
3. **Unnecessary Complexity**: Integration tests primarily verify installation and basic functionality, not PHP version compatibility

## Analysis

### Original Configuration
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    php: ['8.1', '8.2', '8.3']
    uf-version: ['^6.0-beta']
```

This matrix configuration created 3 concurrent jobs:
- Job 1: PHP 8.1 with UserFrosting ^6.0-beta
- Job 2: PHP 8.2 with UserFrosting ^6.0-beta  
- Job 3: PHP 8.3 with UserFrosting ^6.0-beta

### Composer Requirement
From `composer.json`:
```json
"require": {
    "php": "^8.1",
    ...
}
```

The package requires PHP ^8.1, which means 8.1 or higher.

## Solution

Removed the matrix strategy and configured the workflow to test only on PHP 8.1 (the minimum supported version).

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Matrix Strategy**
   ```yaml
   # Before
   strategy:
     matrix:
       php: ['8.1', '8.2', '8.3']
       uf-version: ['^6.0-beta']
   
   # After
   # (removed entirely)
   ```

2. **Hardcoded PHP Version**
   ```yaml
   # Before
   php-version: ${{ matrix.php }}
   
   # After
   php-version: '8.1'
   ```

3. **Updated Summary Message**
   ```yaml
   # Before
   echo "✅ Integration test completed for PHP ${{ matrix.php }} with UserFrosting ${{ matrix.uf-version }}"
   
   # After
   echo "✅ Integration test completed for PHP 8.1 with UserFrosting ^6.0-beta"
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced CI/CD Usage**: 66% reduction in GitHub Actions minutes (1 job instead of 3)
2. **Faster Feedback**: Single job completes in ~5-10 minutes vs waiting for 3 jobs
3. **Simpler Configuration**: No matrix variables to maintain
4. **Sufficient Coverage**: Integration tests verify installation and basic functionality, which is consistent across PHP versions

## Testing Philosophy

### What Integration Tests Should Cover
- ✅ Package installation via Composer
- ✅ Sprinkle registration and loading
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Frontend asset building
- ✅ Basic schema loading
- ✅ API endpoint availability

### What Integration Tests Don't Need to Cover
- ❌ PHP version-specific compatibility (covered by unit tests if needed)
- ❌ Performance across PHP versions
- ❌ PHP version-specific behavior differences

## Alternative Approach for PHP Version Testing

If PHP version compatibility testing is needed in the future, consider:

1. **Separate Workflow**: Create a dedicated "PHP Compatibility Test" workflow that runs less frequently (e.g., weekly, on releases)
2. **Unit Tests Only**: Test PHP compatibility with faster unit tests rather than full integration tests
3. **Conditional Matrix**: Use matrix strategy only on release branches or tags

## Impact

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **CI/CD Cost**: Reduced by ~66%
- **Workflow Duration**: Reduced from waiting for 3 jobs to 1 job
- **Coverage**: No loss of meaningful test coverage

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/integration-test.yml` - Removed matrix strategy, updated PHP version references

## Validation

- ✅ YAML syntax validated with Python yaml parser
- ✅ Git diff reviewed
- ✅ Changes committed successfully
- ⏳ Next workflow run will verify single job execution
