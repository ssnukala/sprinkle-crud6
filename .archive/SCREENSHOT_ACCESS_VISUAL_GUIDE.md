## Expected User Experience

### Positive Outcomes
✅ Users immediately see where to find screenshots  
✅ Direct links reduce confusion  
✅ Summary provides context about what screenshots show  
✅ Multiple access paths accommodate different user preferences  
✅ Instructions are self-contained in the workflow  

### Potential Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: User doesn't see the summary
**Solution**: Summary is prominently displayed at top, hard to miss

**Issue**: User clicks link but doesn't scroll to artifacts
**Solution**: Summary instructions explicitly say "scroll to the bottom"

**Issue**: User expects to view screenshots inline
**Solution**: Summary explains screenshots are in downloadable ZIP file

**Issue**: Screenshots expired (after 30 days)
**Solution**: Summary includes retention period note

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are NOT part of current implementation but could be considered:

1. **Inline Screenshot Preview**: Upload screenshots to external service (e.g., Imgur) and embed in summary
2. **Automatic Screenshot Posting**: Post screenshots as PR comment
3. **Screenshot Comparison**: Compare screenshots between runs
4. **Interactive Viewer**: HTML page with screenshot viewer included in artifacts

## Conclusion

The enhancement significantly improves user experience by:
- Reducing steps required to find screenshots
- Providing clear, prominent instructions
- Offering multiple access paths
- Maintaining all existing functionality

Users can now find and access screenshots with minimal confusion, addressing the primary issue raised in the problem statement.
