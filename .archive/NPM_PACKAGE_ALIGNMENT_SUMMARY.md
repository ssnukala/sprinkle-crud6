# NPM Package Configuration Alignment Summary

## Date
October 22, 2025

## Issue
The npm package configuration for sprinkle-crud6 needed to be aligned with UserFrosting 6 sprinkle standards, specifically matching the patterns used in `@userfrosting/sprinkle-admin` and `@userfrosting/sprinkle-account`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed `.npmignore` File
- **Reason**: Reference sprinkles (sprinkle-admin, sprinkle-account) don't use `.npmignore`
- **Approach**: They rely solely on the `files` array in `package.json` to specify what to include
- **Benefit**: Simpler, more explicit configuration with less room for error

### 2. Updated `package.json`
Removed three sections that are not needed in a library package:

#### Removed `scripts` Section
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest run",
  "test:watch": "vitest"
}
```
- Scripts are for local development only
- Not needed in published package
- Parent applications handle their own build/test scripts

#### Removed `dependencies` Section
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@modyfi/vite-plugin-yaml": "^1.1.1",
  "@vitejs/plugin-vue": "^6.0.1",
  "@vue/tsconfig": "^0.8.1",
  "happy-dom": "^18.0.1",
  "vitest": "^3.2.4"
}
```
- These are development/build dependencies
- Should not be bundled with the package
- Parent application provides build tooling

#### Removed `devDependencies` Section
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@tsconfig/node20": "^20.1.6",
  "playwright": "^1.49.0"
}
```
- Development dependencies for local testing
- Not published with npm packages
- Already excluded from published package

## What Remains in package.json

### Kept: peerDependencies
```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "@userfrosting/sprinkle-account": "^6.0.0-beta",
  "@userfrosting/sprinkle-admin": "^6.0.0-beta",
  "@userfrosting/sprinkle-core": "^6.0.0-beta",
  "@userfrosting/theme-pink-cupcake": "^6.0.0-beta",
  "axios": "^1.12.0",
  "limax": "^4.1.0",
  "pinia": "^2.1.6",
  "pinia-plugin-persistedstate": "^3.2.0",
  "uikit": "^3.21.0",
  "vue": "^3.4.21",
  "vue-router": "^4.2.4"
}
```
- Correctly declares runtime dependencies
- Parent application provides these packages
- Follows library best practices

### Kept: files Array
```json
"files": [
  "app/assets",
  "app/schema/"
]
```
- Explicitly defines what to include in published package
- Only frontend code (app/assets) and JSON schemas (app/schema)
- No PHP backend code, development files, or configuration

## Verification

### NPM Package Contents
The published npm package now contains only:
- `app/assets/` - Frontend Vue.js components, composables, stores, routes, plugins
- `app/schema/` - JSON schema definitions
- `LICENSE` - License file
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `package.json` - Package metadata

**Total**: 37 files, 25.5 KB compressed, 114.9 KB uncompressed

### What's Excluded from NPM Package
- ✅ PHP backend code (`app/src/`)
- ✅ Composer files (`composer.json`)
- ✅ PHP tests (`app/tests/`)
- ✅ Development configuration (`vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `phpunit.xml`)
- ✅ Examples directory (`examples/`)
- ✅ Documentation source (`docs/`, `.archive/`)
- ✅ GitHub workflows (`.github/`)
- ✅ Development container (`.devcontainer/`)
- ✅ IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)

### Composer Package (Unchanged)
The Composer package correctly includes:
- ✅ PHP backend code (`app/src/`)
- ✅ Frontend code (`app/assets/`) - needed for asset compilation in parent app
- ✅ JSON schemas (`app/schema/`)
- ✅ Documentation and license files

## Benefits

1. **Smaller Package Size**: No unnecessary development dependencies
2. **Standards Compliance**: Matches official UserFrosting sprinkle patterns
3. **Cleaner Installation**: No dependency conflicts or version mismatches
4. **Better Separation**: Clear separation between library dependencies (peer) and development tools
5. **Simpler Maintenance**: Less configuration to maintain

## Impact on Development

### For Package Consumers (Other Projects)
- ✅ No change - package works exactly the same
- ✅ Cleaner node_modules - no unnecessary dependencies
- ✅ Faster installation

### For Sprinkle Development (This Repository)
- Development dependencies (vitest, vite plugins, etc.) are still available in the repository
- Configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json) remain for local development
- Tests can still be run locally
- No impact on development workflow

## Alignment with Reference Sprinkles

This configuration now matches the pattern used by:
- `@userfrosting/sprinkle-admin` (6.0.0-beta.5)
- `@userfrosting/sprinkle-account` (6.0.0-beta.5)

Both reference sprinkles:
- ❌ Don't have `.npmignore`
- ❌ Don't have `scripts` section
- ❌ Don't have `dependencies` section
- ❌ Don't have `devDependencies` section
- ✅ Have only `peerDependencies`
- ✅ Use `files` array to control package contents

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Created npm package with `npm pack`
2. ✅ Verified package contents (only frontend assets)
3. ✅ Installed package in test project
4. ✅ Verified no PHP/development files included
5. ✅ Verified peerDependencies structure
6. ✅ Compared with reference sprinkle packages

## Files Modified

1. **Deleted**: `.npmignore` (76 lines)
2. **Modified**: `package.json` (removed 3 sections)

## Conclusion

The npm package configuration is now fully aligned with UserFrosting 6 sprinkle standards. The package contains only frontend code and schemas, making it suitable for consumption by UserFrosting 6 applications via npm. The Composer package remains unchanged and continues to deliver both PHP backend and frontend code as expected for a UserFrosting sprinkle.
