# Issue Fix Summary - PageList and PageDetail Issues

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Breadcrumbs Disappeared
**Problem:** Breadcrumbs were not showing on both `crud6/groups` and `crud6/groups/1` pages.

**Root Cause:** 
- Route metadata had empty strings for title: `meta: { title: '', description: '' }`
- Vue components set `page.title` asynchronously after schema loads
- Breadcrumb component rendered before page.title was updated, resulting in empty breadcrumb

**Solution:**
- Set `page.title` immediately on component mount with capitalized model name
- Update `page.title` with schema title after schema loads
- This ensures breadcrumb always has a title to display

**Files Changed:**
- `app/assets/views/PageList.vue` - Line 90: Set initial title immediately
- `app/assets/views/PageRow.vue` - Line 251: Set initial title immediately

### Issue 2: Users Table Not Showing Data
**Problem:** On `crud6/groups/1` detail page, the users table showed "Showing 0 - 0 of 0" with no data.

**Root Cause:**
- `Details.vue` called `loadSchema()` at top level without awaiting
- Schema was not loaded when template rendered
- `getFieldLabel()` and `getFieldType()` returned fallback values
- Title was not translated properly

**Solution:**
- Move `loadSchema()` call to `onMounted()` with async/await
- Add `schemaLoading` state from composable
- Show loading spinner while schema is loading
- Use `$t()` for title translation with fallback to schema title
- Only render table after schema is loaded

**Files Changed:**
- `app/assets/components/CRUD6/Details.vue`:
  - Line 2: Import `onMounted` and `ref`
  - Line 13: Extract `schemaLoading` from composable
  - Lines 19-22: Use `onMounted` with async/await
  - Lines 30-42: Enhanced title logic with translation fallback
  - Lines 60-65: Added loading state UI
  - Line 68: Added `v-else` to table to wait for schema

### Issue 3: Edit Button Requires 2 Clicks
**Problem:** The Edit Group button required clicking twice to launch the modal.

**Root Cause:**
- First click triggered `requestEditModal()` which added ID to the Set
- First anchor had `class="uk-drop-close"` which closed the dropdown
- User had to click Actions again, then click Edit to actually open modal
- Same issue affected Delete button

**Solution:**
- Remove `uk-drop-close` class from the placeholder edit/delete anchor tags
- Keep `uk-drop-close` only on the actual modal trigger components
- This keeps the dropdown open after loading the modal component
- User can then click the Edit/Delete link without reopening dropdown

**Files Changed:**
- `app/assets/views/PageList.vue`:
  - Line 211: Removed `class="uk-drop-close"` from edit placeholder
  - Line 227: Removed `class="uk-drop-close"` from delete placeholder
  - Lines 216-222: Edit modal component still has `uk-drop-close`
  - Lines 232-238: Delete modal component still has `uk-drop-close`

## Technical Details

### Breadcrumb Flow (Before Fix)
```
1. Route registered with meta: { title: '' }
2. Component mounts
3. Breadcrumb renders with empty title → EMPTY BREADCRUMB
4. Schema loads asynchronously
5. page.title updated → TOO LATE for initial breadcrumb
```

### Breadcrumb Flow (After Fix)
```
1. Route registered with meta: { title: '' }
2. Component mounts
3. page.title set immediately with model name → "Groups"
4. Breadcrumb renders with title → VISIBLE BREADCRUMB
5. Schema loads asynchronously
6. page.title updated with schema title → "Group Management"
7. Breadcrumb updates → PROPER TITLE
```

### Detail Section Flow (Before Fix)
```
1. Details.vue component created
2. loadSchema() called (not awaited)
3. Template renders immediately
4. getFieldLabel() returns fallbacks
5. UFSprunjeTable renders with default field names
6. Schema loads later → NO RE-RENDER
7. Table shows 0 records
```

### Detail Section Flow (After Fix)
```
1. Details.vue component created
2. onMounted() called
3. Loading spinner shown
4. await loadSchema() completes
5. schemaLoaded set to true
6. Template renders with proper schema
7. getFieldLabel() uses schema field labels
8. UFSprunjeTable renders with correct configuration
9. Table loads and displays data
```

### Edit Modal Flow (Before Fix)
```
1. User clicks Actions
2. Dropdown opens
3. User clicks Edit (first time)
4. requestEditModal() adds ID to Set
5. Dropdown closes (uk-drop-close)
6. Edit modal component renders
7. User must click Actions again
8. Dropdown opens again
9. User clicks Edit link (actual modal)
10. Modal opens
```

### Edit Modal Flow (After Fix)
```
1. User clicks Actions
2. Dropdown opens
3. User clicks Edit (first time)
4. requestEditModal() adds ID to Set
5. Dropdown STAYS OPEN (no uk-drop-close)
6. Edit modal component renders
7. User clicks Edit link immediately
8. Modal opens
```
