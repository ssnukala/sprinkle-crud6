# Breadcrumb Fix - Summary for User

## Problem
"the breadcrumb still does not show"

## Solution
Restored the 0.3.3 route configuration which had working breadcrumbs.

## What Was Changed

### 1. List Route (crud6.list) - Main Fix
**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
meta: {
    permission: { slug: 'uri_crud6' },
    title: 'CRUD6.PAGE',           // ❌ Causing conflict
    description: 'CRUD6.PAGE_DESCRIPTION'  // ❌ Causing conflict
}
```

**After (Fixed - matching 0.3.3):**
```typescript
meta: {
    permission: { slug: 'uri_crud6' }
    // ✅ No title/description - allows dynamic updates
}
```

### 2. View Route (crud6.view) - Consistency Fix
- Changed description from `'CRUD6.PAGE_DESCRIPTION'` to `'CRUD6.INFO_PAGE'` (as in 0.3.3)
- Moved title/description before permission (as in 0.3.3)

## Why This Fixes Breadcrumbs

1. **Without route meta title/description:**
   - PageList.vue can freely set `page.title` dynamically
   - Breadcrumb component reads from `page.title` properly
   - No conflict between static and dynamic values

2. **With route meta title/description (broken):**
   - Static `title: 'CRUD6.PAGE'` resolves to `{{model}}` at build time
   - Conflicts with Vue component trying to set dynamic values
   - Breadcrumbs don't initialize or update correctly

## Expected Results

### List Page (/crud6/groups)
```
Initial:  UserFrosting / Groups (from capitalized model name)
          ↓
After:    UserFrosting / Group Management (from schema.title)
```

### View Page (/crud6/groups/1)
```
UserFrosting / {{model}} / [Record Name]
```
(View page keeps translation placeholder from route meta)

## Verification

✅ All tests pass (5 tests)
✅ Configuration matches working 0.3.3 release exactly
✅ Only difference: path has `/crud6/:model` instead of `crud6/:model` (intentional)

## Files Changed
1. `app/assets/routes/CRUD6Routes.ts` - Restored 0.3.3 configuration
2. `app/assets/tests/router/routes.test.ts` - Updated expectations
3. `.archive/BREADCRUMB_0.3.3_RESTORATION.md` - Detailed explanation
4. `.archive/BREADCRUMB_0.3.3_VISUAL.md` - Visual before/after comparison

## Next Steps

Deploy and test in your application. Breadcrumbs should now:
1. ✅ Be visible on all CRUD6 pages
2. ✅ Show model name initially
3. ✅ Update to schema title after loading
4. ✅ Work consistently across list and view pages
